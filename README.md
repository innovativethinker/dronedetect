Drone Detects Misssion

The goal of the Drone Detect company  is to create a cheap system of drone detection for civilian use. Examples where this is useful will be for people who are concerned for there privacy and have large acreages that are hard to monitor. Florida Fish and Wildlife have no drone zones for hunters using the wildlife management areas (WMA) and this can deter illegal use of drones and help monitor millions of square acres of state conservations, preservations and W.M.A's. Airports around the world can make use if this detection system to keep airspace safe for airlines and there passengers. Drone detect can offer fast response of drone detection invading unauthorized airspace.

YOLO

Real-world Applications: YOLO has been successfully used in various real-world applications, including surveillance, security, and autonomous systems, which are areas where drone detection is crucial.
